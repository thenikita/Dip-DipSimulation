# Dipole-Dipole Simulator
**Short summary:**
  This code is designed to perform a numerical experiment with dipole gas in a magnetic field.
  By some reason we need to make things in concrete conditions to get reasonable results, so
  you will have an opportunity to set everything you need up. 
  
**Current status:**
- [X] Working with N particles in constant volume tube with no demagnetisation

**Aiming to:**
- [ ] Resizing tube to get target volume density
  
**Things done:**
- [X] Basic shit
- [X] Everything looks working for one particle

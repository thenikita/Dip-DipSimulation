# DIPOLE-DIPOLE SIMULATION
**Short summary:**
  This code is designed to perform a numerical experiment with dipole gas in a magnetic fieldModule.
  By some reason we need to make things in concrete conditions to get reasonable results, so
  you will have an opportunity to set everything you need up. 
  
## Success
**Things done:**
- [X] Basic shit
- [X] Everything looks working for one particle
- [X] Resizing the tube for any amount of particles
